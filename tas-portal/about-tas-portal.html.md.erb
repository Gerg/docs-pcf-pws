owner: TAS Developer Portal
---

TAS Developer Portal allows you to view applications and services running for your organization on TAS for VMs. You can view dependencies, relationships, technical documentation, and the service status.

You can now also configure branding, and store TAS Developer Portal settings to an external MySQL or PostgreSQL database for data persistence.

TAS Developer Portal is a tool for developers built from the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) project [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

TAS Developer Portal consists of the following components:

* **Your organization catalog:** The catalog serves as the primary visual representation of your
  running services (components) and applications (systems).

* **TAS Developer Portal plug-ins:** These plug-ins expose capabilities regarding specific Tanzu Application
  Service tools. The supported plug-ins are:

  * Runtime Resources Visibility

* **TechDocs:** This plug-in enables you to store your technical documentation in Markdown format in
  a source-code repository and display it alongside the relevant catalog entries.

* **Git repository:** TAS Developer Portal stores the following in a Git repository:

  * The structure for your application catalog.
  * Your technical documentation about the catalog items, if you enable TAS Developer Portal TechDocs
    capabilities.

You can host the structure for your application catalog and your technical documentation in the same
repository as your source code.
