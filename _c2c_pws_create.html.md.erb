### Prerequisite

To use the plugin, you must have the `network.write` UAA scope. 
This scope gives you the right to create a policy between any two apps in spaces for which 
you are a Space Developer. If you do not have this scope, you must request it 
by opening a support ticket with PWS at support@run.pivotal.io.
